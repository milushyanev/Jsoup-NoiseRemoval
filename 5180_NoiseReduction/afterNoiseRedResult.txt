Giving to the Library
Cal Poly Pomona’s University Library is the dynamic center of campus that serves all students. The library combines digital resources and state-of-the-art technology with traditional holdings. Expert librarians and staff encourage discovery, creativity and collaboration, and expand the knowledge students gain in the classroom. The library offers shared and private spaces for more than 10,000 students each day to enjoy an independent learning environment, to explore information and create their own ideas. Discover how you can enhance our students’ learning experience.
MAKE A DIFFERENCE
There are many options to match your interest to the library needs and support student success:
FUND-RAISING PRIORITIES
Maker Studio
An innovative lab open to all Cal Poly Pomona students, the Maker Studio is a place where they can gain hands-on experience with industrystandard creative technology, including 3D printers and scanners, laser and vinyl cutters, and a letterpress. Maker Studio encourages students to collaborate, experiment and develop skills that will prepare them for the future of work. Your gift will support space expansion and additional equipment to provide more access to these advanced technologies.
Knowledge Center
The Knowledge Center encourages collaborative learning and is staffed by librarians and student assistants providing personalized support on how to access and use the library’s resources, both print and electronic. The center offers a holistic approach to supporting students’ needs to ensure they have the resources and services needed to complete their degree, develop into lifelong learners, and launch their careers. Various activities take place in this area including study groups, tutoring sessions, mini-workshops, student advising and consultations with librarians. Your support will help to expand the program and update equipment.
Affordable Learning Initiative
This initiative provides faculty and students access to affordable, high-quality course materials. The Affordable Learning Initiative (ALI) finds a balance between cost, access and quality of educational content to offset the burdensome expense of costly course materials to students. ALI expands learning options to alternative materials and supports the campus’ efforts on open educational resources. Your gift will provide students free access to course materials, including e-books and full-text databases.
Special Collections and Archives
Special Collections and Archives collect, organize, preserve, and make available Cal Poly Pomona's rare books and archival collections. The collections center around themes relevant to the mission of the university and are available for use by all interested users including students, faculty, staff, alumni, and the general research community. Special Collections and Archives actively acquires new materials on a regular basis in our subject strengths. We house the University Archives, the Southern California Wine and Wine Industry Collection, the Pomona Valley Historical Collection, and the W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Library.
Community support for preserving our region's history and our main collecting areas is essential. We welcome financial gifts to support our mission which will be used towards purchasing collections, archival supplies, exhibition cases, digitizing materials, hiring student assistants, and special projects like our planned renovation or to launch our fellowship program.

University Library Strategic Plan: 2019-2024
Mission Statement
The University Library supports student success by providing effective and equitable access to resources, information, and data to students, faculty, and staff in support of the University’s instruction, research, and public service goals; by creating welcoming and innovative learning environment where information can be explored and assimilated into knowledge; and by responding to the need of the University community to be information literate and lifelong learners. We do this by
Vision Statement
The University Library will be the center of inspiration, discovery, creativity, and collaboration - indispensable to learning, teaching, scholarship and life-long learning.
Organizational Values
The Library supports the University's core values.
Library's Strategic Initiatives and Goals
The Library Strategic Plan is built on goals that support Cal Poly Pomona's five strategic initiatives. In the past, the Library articulated its own initiatives which were specific to the world of librarianship and addressed Library concerns. We connected these initiatives to the campus plan by including information in our strategic plan that showed the alignment of each plan with the other. For this planning cycle, the Library used the campus' five strategic initiatives as the foundation for the development of our goals. Therefore, there was no need for the additional step of describing where the alignment occurred. This is also a straight forward approach to documenting how the Library is specifically participating in and supporting the strategic initiatives of the campus.
Initiative 1. Deliver quality programs that promote integrative learning, discovery, and creativity
The Library will support this initiative with the following goals that deal with Library resources, accessibility, technology, Library spaces, and Library services:
Initiative 2. Enhance student learning, development, and success
The services that the Library provide are essential to the success of our students and to the overall excellence of the University. Building upon our core services, we will intensify our efforts to support intellectual curiosity and to remove any existing or potential barriers to information discovery and delivery.
Initiative 3. Prepare our students for the future of work and civic engagement
The Library recognizes the importance of providing support for students while they are pursuing their degree as well as after graduation. We are committed to providing on-going opportunities for lifelong learning skills, for civic engagement, and for connections with alumni, the community, and industry leaders.
Initiative 4. Strengthen our economic vitality and impact
Promote and develop support for the Library's collections and services by engaging the university and wider communities through fundraising, partnerships, publications, exhibitions, and events.
Initiative 5. Advance organizational development and employee excellence
A constantly growing and evolving academic environment requires a high-caliber, engaged, and fulfilled Library staff that can both adapt to changes and create and advocate for changes it deems critical to the University's and the Library's success. The Library depends upon a vibrant work culture, one that encourages collaboration, embraces change, and respects a diversity of staff identities, thoughts, and actions. This is necessary to the Library's continued success in support of curricular and non-curricular needs of the University and community.

Friends of the Library

One of the Library's highest priorities is the formation of a Friends of the Library group. The Friends Organizing Group, a committee of librarians and library staff is working to lay the groundwork for the organization. We are expecting to have a nucleus of members dedicated to taking leadership of this important group.
Join now and become a part of this exciting opportunity!
Volunteer Docents for the Library:
Are you a retired Cal Poly Pomona University faculty or staff? Do you have some time to help at the Library? Here's an opportunity to help! Docents have the opportunity to interact with a wide range of students, faculty, staff, and visitors and to learn more about our wonderful campus. With additional docents we could increase our hours of service.

Library Policies
Code of Conduct
The University Library is responsible for providing patrons with a pleasant and productive environment for study and research, as well as to protect the library materials and facilities. The following policies apply to Library users in all public service areas:
It is the policy of the Library to maintain an environment appropriate for the protection of library materials and conducive to study in all library locations. You are welcome to bring your food and drink into the library. Exceptions: No food or drink allowed in Special Collections, the W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Library, or the Maker Studio, except during University sponsored events. No food at computer stations. When bringing food into the library please be responsible and considerate of others.
We ask you to adhere to the following Food and Drink guidelines:
The Library reserves the right to ask any patron to remove food and/or beverage from the Library based on this policy. In addition, failure to comply with posted restrictions or staff instructions regarding the consumption of food and beverages constitutes a violation of the Library Code of Conduct.
http://www.cpp.edu/~policies/university/facilities/animal_policy_procedures.shtml
The following are prohibited conduct:
It is expected that library staff requests for compliance with these rules will be immediately and civilly honored. Depending upon the seriousness of the infraction, refusal to comply with library rules may result in:
Social Media Policy
This social media policy defines best practices for maintaining the University Library’s social media outlets, including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, Google Plus, and YouTube.
All posts to library social media are intended to support the University Library’s mission. In general, posts to social media will include information related to the library’s services, building, or patrons. The overarching goal of the University Library’s social media is to increase reach and interaction with current, past, and potential library users.
Administration of Social Media Channels
The University Library’s social media channels are monitored and maintained on a daily basis by members of the Library Outreach Committee. Those maintaining the social media should remember that all posts represent the University Library and the University and should adhere to the following general guidelines (adapted under a CC-BY-SA 3.0 license from CUNY Academic Commons):
Publicizing Content from the University and/or the Community
Outside groups including campus departments, student groups, or community groups may request that the University Library publicize something for them via the library’s social media channels. Non-commercial publicity related to Cal Poly Pomona students, staff, or faculty is acceptable; commercial publicity is not accepted unless it is something supported by a CPP program. For instance, products sold by a CPP sponsored program in support of student learning could potentially be publicized; however, apps developed by people not associated with any official CPP group would not be publicized.
Rules for Online Behavior on Social Media
The Library will not post items or comments that are obscene, racist, derogatory, or similarly objectionable in their content:
We appreciate feedback and discussions related to the Library. We also welcome promotional announcements for groups and interests affiliated with the University. Cal Poly Pomona University Library reserves the right to add, remove, and edit content on this page. If you find inappropriate content, please notify us via email or text at : libraryhelp@cpp.edu.
Library Outreach Committee; Approved by the Library Outreach Committee on 12/16/14; Approved by Library Administration on 01/07/15; Revised on 4/03/15
Classroom Usage Policy
1. Statement of Purpose: The University Library at Cal Poly Pomona has three classrooms designated primarily for its use. These classrooms are 15-1828 (capacity 30), 15-2907 (capacity 45 with computers, 60 without), 15-2913 (capacity 15 with computers, 25 without). The primary purpose of these classrooms is to provide Library faculty and staff with designated spaces for providing information literacy instruction to Cal Poly Pomona students.
2. Learning Resource Center: In accordance with long-standing agreements with the Learning Resource Center, these classrooms are also made available to their instructors for the providing of classes, workshops and preparatory sessions for the GWT.
3. Athletic Study Hall: In accordance with long-standing agreements with Athletic Affairs, classroom 15-1828 is made available Monday-Thursday between the hours of 4pm-10pm.
4. Orientation Services: Also in accordance with long-standing agreements, the library classrooms are made available to Orientation Services during the Summer months to assist in new student orientation.
5. Other Authorized Uses: Beyond these two primary purposes, access to these classrooms may be provided for the following purposes upon request:
6. Approval of Requests for Use: Any and all requests for classroom usage in the above categories is subject to review and approval by either Library Administration or the Library Instruction Coordinator. Approval of usage is subject to the following policies:
7. Failure to Comply with Policies: Failure to abide by any of these policies may result in a user's access to the library classroom for a class, workshop, event, etc. being revoked.
8. Public Availability of Policies: A copy of these policies shall be publicly available on the Library Website.
Privacy Policy
It is the policy of the Cal Poly Pomona University Library to respect the privacy of all users to the extent physically and logistically possible and permitted by law. The Library will not reveal the identities of individual users (names, addresses, telephone numbers, BroncoNumbers) or reveal what information sources or services they consult (books checked out, websites visited), to anyone outside the library organization unless required to do so by law. Also, this information is only shared within the Library on a need to know basis. This policy applies to all resources regardless of their format or means of delivery as well as to all services offered by the Library.
For examples of how this policy applies to specific library services, see below.
Circulation
The Library does not reveal the names of individual borrowers nor reveal what materials are charged to any individual, except as required by law. The Library does not keep a permanent ongoing record of borrowing for any individual: however, the Library catalog's back-up files may retain borrowing information for up to a week after an item is returned. When the catalog retains the checkout history of an item, that information remains confidential within the Library. The Library PIN/Password is encrypted. Access to “My Library Account” is a secured login. For your protection, you will be asked to come to the Library in person and to present identification if there are problems with your Library PIN/Password.
Document Delivery/Interlibrary Loan
Documentation of requests is retained as necessary for the Library to comply with auditing, copyright or other regulations. Because of the software the Library uses this documentation will include names of borrowers. Personal information provided in order to request ILL service might be forwarded on to other library lenders. In some cases, information about requests may be shared with other library staff for collection development and fine collection purposes; however, it remains confidential within the library.
Library Surveys/Assessment Projects
Information and data obtained by the Library through surveys or other means, whose intended use it to provide assessment of services, collections, facilities, etc., are considered confidential and will not be shared except in aggregations, to protect the privacy of individual participants.
Online Access
Information collected from the Library Web site is not made available to any other entity outside the Library except as required by law. There are different types of information that the Library may collect during your visit to our web site and associated web sites, including the following:
Public Workstations
While the Library will endeavor to protect the privacy of patron use of Library computers, patrons should be aware, when using Library computers, that the Library cannot and does not guarantee privacy. Patrons should not have an expectation of total security in a networked system of shared public-access computers. Since the computers are located in public areas, other users or Library Staff members may observe what is on the computer screen. Patrons who enter private information while using a Library computer should logoff and close browser programs when they are finished with their transactions.
Donor Privacy
Gifts and contributions make an important contribution to building and shaping the Library's collections. These donations can be made in an anonymous or private manner if so desired.
Responsible Use of Electronic Resources
Cal Poly Pomona's Appropriate Use Policy for Information Technology begins with the statement:
It is imperative that all users of the University's computing, communications, and information resources realize how much these resources require responsible behavior from all users. Simply put, we are all responsible for the well-being of the computing, network, and information resources we use.
This includes the appropriate and responsible use of electronic resources provided by the Library – the electronic journals, electronic books, and databases many of you use on a daily basis.
Publishers and content providers require us to sign license agreements as part of the subscription process. License agreements generally include provisions intended to prevent unauthorized use or redistribution of the licensed content.
What is unauthorized use or redistribution?
Details vary, but here are some general guidelines:
Usually it's OK to:
In general, our license agreements DO NOT allow:
Inappropriate use impacts the entire campus
The consequences for violating terms of the licensing agreements can be very serious. When publishers and content providers detect inappropriate use of their content they will generally cut off our access to the journal or database. Often this impacts access to all journals from that publisher for the entire campus community.
For example, if a publisher detects that a member of the Cal Poly Pomona community is downloading every article from a journal, access to that journal will be suspended. If the journal is part of a publisher's package (e.g., Springer, IEEE), the publisher might also suspend access to all journals in the package. If the publisher's website hosts journals from other publishers, access to journals from those publishers might also be impacted.
Repeated violations can result in a license being permanently revoked.
Has this happened at Cal Poly Pomona?
Yes. We have had several license violations in recent years. For example, in late summer our access to all journals on the American Institute of Physics website was suspended because of excessive downloading from one AIP journal.
What are we doing to prevent this?
We are trying to educate the Cal Poly Pomona community about responsible use and the serious consequences of license violations. This webpage is part of our effort. We will periodically send informational emails to all faculty, staff, and students. Librarians will address responsible use of electronic resources in classes and workshops. We encourage faculty to address responsible use of electronic resources when making research assignments.
In addition, when the Library is able to determine that an individual is responsible for a license violation we will take steps to contact the individual and inform him or her about the license violation. We believe that most license violations are unintentional, that the individuals do not realize that their actions are viewed as violations by the publishers.
If repeated violations occur however, we will have to take further action by referring the case to Judicial Affairs, Faculty Affairs, or Human Resources. This is necessary to protect access for all Library users.
Publishers and content providers are very serious about responsible use. We need to take it seriously as well.
If you have questions about license agreements for specific resources, please contact Yvonne Zhang: ywzhang@cpp.edu or (909) 869-3107.

These classrooms are 15-1828 (capacity 30), 15-2907 (capacity 45 with computers, 60 without), 15-2913 (capacity 15 with computers, 25 without). The primary purpose of these classrooms is to provide Library faculty and staff with designated spaces for providing information literacy instruction to Cal Poly Pomona students.

8. Public Availability of Policies: A copy of these policies shall be publicly available on the Library Website.
Privacy Policy
It is the policy of the Cal Poly Pomona University Library to respect the privacy of all users to the extent physically and logistically possible and permitted by law. The Library will not reveal the identities of individual users (names, addresses, telephone numbers, BroncoNumbers) or reveal what information sources or services they consult (books checked out, websites visited), to anyone outside the library organization unless required to do so by law. Also, this information is only shared within the Library on a need to know basis. This policy applies to all resources regardless of their format or means of delivery as well as to all services offered by the Library.
For examples of how this policy applies to specific library services, see below.
Circulation
The Library does not reveal the names of individual borrowers nor reveal what materials are charged to any individual, except as required by law. The Library does not keep a permanent ongoing record of borrowing for any individual: however, the Library catalog's back-up files may retain borrowing information for up to a week after an item is returned. When the catalog retains the checkout history of an item, that information remains confidential within the Library. The Library PIN/Password is encrypted. Access to “My Library Account” is a secured login. For your protection, you will be asked to come to the Library in person and to present identification if there are problems with your Library PIN/Password.
Document Delivery/Interlibrary Loan
Documentation of requests is retained as necessary for the Library to comply with auditing, copyright or other regulations. Because of the software the Library uses this documentation will include names of borrowers. Personal information provided in order to request ILL service might be forwarded on to other library lenders. In some cases, information about requests may be shared with other library staff for collection development and fine collection purposes; however, it remains confidential within the library.
Library Surveys/Assessment Projects
Information and data obtained by the Library through surveys or other means, whose intended use it to provide assessment of services, collections, facilities, etc., are considered confidential and will not be shared except in aggregations, to protect the privacy of individual participants.
Online Access
Information collected from the Library Web site is not made available to any other entity outside the Library except as required by law. There are different types of information that the Library may collect during your visit to our web site and associated web sites, including the following:
Public Workstations
While the Library will endeavor to protect the privacy of patron use of Library computers, patrons should be aware, when using Library computers, that the Library cannot and does not guarantee privacy. Patrons should not have an expectation of total security in a networked system of shared public-access computers. Since the computers are located in public areas, other users or Library Staff members may observe what is on the computer screen. Patrons who enter private information while using a Library computer should logoff and close browser programs when they are finished with their transactions.
Donor Privacy
Gifts and contributions make an important contribution to building and shaping the Library's collections. These donations can be made in an anonymous or private manner if so desired.
Responsible Use of Electronic Resources
Cal Poly Pomona's Appropriate Use Policy for Information Technology begins with the statement:
It is imperative that all users of the University's computing, communications, and information resources realize how much these resources require responsible behavior from all users. Simply put, we are all responsible for the well-being of the computing, network, and information resources we use.
This includes the appropriate and responsible use of electronic resources provided by the Library – the electronic journals, electronic books, and databases many of you use on a daily basis.
Publishers and content providers require us to sign license agreements as part of the subscription process. License agreements generally include provisions intended to prevent unauthorized use or redistribution of the licensed content.
What is unauthorized use or redistribution?
Details vary, but here are some general guidelines:
Usually it's OK to:
In general, our license agreements DO NOT allow:
Inappropriate use impacts the entire campus
The consequences for violating terms of the licensing agreements can be very serious. When publishers and content providers detect inappropriate use of their content they will generally cut off our access to the journal or database. Often this impacts access to all journals from that publisher for the entire campus community.
For example, if a publisher detects that a member of the Cal Poly Pomona community is downloading every article from a journal, access to that journal will be suspended. If the journal is part of a publisher's package (e.g., Springer, IEEE), the publisher might also suspend access to all journals in the package. If the publisher's website hosts journals from other publishers, access to journals from those publishers might also be impacted.
Repeated violations can result in a license being permanently revoked.
Has this happened at Cal Poly Pomona?
Yes. We have had several license violations in recent years. For example, in late summer our access to all journals on the American Institute of Physics website was suspended because of excessive downloading from one AIP journal.
What are we doing to prevent this?
We are trying to educate the Cal Poly Pomona community about responsible use and the serious consequences of license violations. This webpage is part of our effort. We will periodically send informational emails to all faculty, staff, and students. Librarians will address responsible use of electronic resources in classes and workshops. We encourage faculty to address responsible use of electronic resources when making research assignments.
In addition, when the Library is able to determine that an individual is responsible for a license violation we will take steps to contact the individual and inform him or her about the license violation. We believe that most license violations are unintentional, that the individuals do not realize that their actions are viewed as violations by the publishers.
If repeated violations occur however, we will have to take further action by referring the case to Judicial Affairs, Faculty Affairs, or Human Resources. This is necessary to protect access for all Library users.
Publishers and content providers are very serious about responsible use. We need to take it seriously as well.
If you have questions about license agreements for specific resources, please contact Yvonne Zhang: ywzhang@cpp.edu or (909) 869-3107.

Title -> Animal Policy Procedures
Animal Policy Procedures

University policy allows for animals who are not participating in any University activity to be on University premises as long as they remain outside University buildings, are accompanied by an individual, and are on a leash or confined to a kennel when not under the control of an individual. No animals, except those owned by the University and being used for official University instructional purposes or service animals, are permitted inside University buildings without the prior written approval of the University. Individuals wishing to have an animal participate in any University activity must also have the prior written approval of the University to allow an animal to be present in a University building or to participate in a University activity must sign a Memorandum of Understanding. This MOU requires that the individual indemnify, defend and save harmless the State of California, the Board of Trustees of the California State University, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and the officers, agents, and employees of each of them from any and all loss, damage, or liability that may be suffered or incurred by the Trustees, its officers, agents and employees caused by, arising out of, or in any way connected with the animal. The University does not assume any liability or responsibility for the acts of animals on University premises, except for those animals owned by the University and being used for official University instructional purposes.
Failure to abide by this policy will result in the immediate removal of the animal from University premises and may result in the exclusion of the animal from participation in any future University activity or from being allowed to be present in any University building. The University also reserves the right to request the immediate removal of any animal deemed to be disruptive to the orderly operations of the University.

Cookie Policy
Cookies Information: When you visit the Sites, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Sites. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Sites or services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
Google Analytics: We use a tool called “Google Analytics,” a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. to collect information about use of the Sites. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit our Sites, what pages are visited, and what other sites were visited prior to coming to our Sites. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Sites. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. Google Analytics will also collect contextual information, such as type of web browser, type of operating system, browser resolution, and network location, however
we do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Sites, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’ s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Useand theGoogle Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Sites by disabling cookies on your browser, however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Sites.
Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you register with or view our Sites, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol addresses or other device identifiers, browser information, Internet Service Provider, operating system, location, date/time stamp, clickstream data, referring/exit pages and URLs, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
Clear Gifs Information: When you use the Sites, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personal information is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.
California Do Not Track Disclosures
California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to “Do Not Track” (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. We do not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information about users’ online activities over time and across third party websites when an individual uses our Sites and therefore do not respond to DNT signals.
How we share your information:
We share your information internally at the CSU to facilitate and manage the purposes listed above, including with third parties whom the University engages to process your personal information on our behalf for the purposes stated above (such as vendors who help the University with our marketing, application processing, financial aid or payment processing, education management, and web hosting). The University may also share your personal data with government and law enforcement agencies or regulators (1) to comply with a legal process, subpoena, order or other legal or regulatory requirement applicable to us; (2) to enforce our terms of use or other policies; or (3) to pursue available legal remedies or defend against legal claims. We may also share your personal information with a third party as requested by you if permitted by this and other University policies and applicable laws and regulations. We will not distribute or share any electronically collected personal information (as defined in subdivision (d) of California Government Code section 11015.5) about users to any third party without prior written permission from the user except in narrow circumstances involving possible violations of Section 502 of the Penal Code or as authorized under law (including but not limited to the Information Practices Act), or to assist another state agency or public law enforcement organization in any case where the security of a network operated by a state agency has been, or is suspected of having been, breached.
We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our Sites or services for illegal activities. We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. Release of your personal information for security purposes, as described in this Notice to any person or entity, including, without limitation, in connection with any government investigation or litigation, shall be based on a determination made solely by us, as permitted by law or, for those not in the EEA, exercising our discretion for which you expressly grant permission to us in accordance with this Notice.
How we protect your information:
We take reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information against loss, unauthorized access, and illegal use or disclosure. Such personal information is stored by the University in secure locations and University staff is trained on procedures for the management of personal information, including limitations on the release of information. Access to personal information is limited to those members of the University’s staff whose work requires such access. Confidential information is destroyed according to the University’s records retention schedule. The University conducts periodic reviews to ensure that proper information management policies and procedures are understood and followed.
The security of your personal information is important to us, but please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to the Sites, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. While we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.
We encourage all individuals to use appropriate safeguards to secure their computers and the information on those computers. For additional information on online privacy and security, please see the University’s policies and procedures related to Information Security; you may also consult with the California Attorney General’s Privacy Enforcement and Protection website.
In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly investigate and notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in the CSU Information Security Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Sites nor the information or content contained in them, and we make no warranty, either express or implied, concerning the content of any such site, including the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability of them for any particular purpose, nor do we warrant that any such site or content is free from any claims of copyright, trademark, or other infringement of the rights of third parties, or that any such site or content is devoid of viruses or other contamination. We may provide links to other websites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of linked sites does not imply endorsement by the University or CSU of any of the linked sites.

Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our Sites, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. We do not ensure the security of your personal information if you visit websites not belonging to CSU, nor are we the data controller for any information collected on those sites unless we specifically state so. We further reserve the right to terminate a link to a third party site at any time.

You can ask to review, update or make changes to the personal information we maintain about you, or exercise your option of having your personal information discarded without reuse or distribution, by sending a written request to the postal or email address set out below. We may take a reasonable period of time to respond. If you request the deactivation or change of information on our system, such information may be retained in our backup systems for a period of time subject to technology restrictions, or as a precaution against systems failures. Some information may be retained for longer periods as required by law, contract or auditing requirements or as otherwise described in this Notice.
You have the option to decline providing information about yourself online and may use other methods, such as U.S. mail, to respond to requests for information or to communicate with us. You may use the contact information listed below to ask about additional alternatives to providing or obtaining information through use of our Sites.
By providing us your email address, you consent to our use of your email address to send you Site and service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.

Where required by law, we will obtain your consent before sending you specific types of email or other communications.
You can choose not to receive such emails from us by “unsubscribing” using the instructions in any email you receive from us, or by sending a written request to the postal or email address set out below. It may take up to thirty (30) business days for us to process your request. This will not stop us from sending emails about your account or your transactions with us, or any other service-related email. Opting out does not affect our communications with you via telephone or mail nor does it affect our use of your non-personally identifiable information as described in this Notice.

You have the right to contact us in connection with the exercise of your rights under applicable EEA law, which you can do through the contact information below, or by sending an email to privacy@cpp.edu. We will respond to your written request without unreasonable delay and in accordance with any deadlines imposed by law.

President's Welcome
Welcome to our website. I am honored to be the new president of Cal Poly Pomona. I have been entrusted with continuing the academic excellence of this university and enriching the quality of student life. I have gained a deep respect for the traditions here. Naturally, I have also enjoyed the unmatched beauty of this campus.
As I begin my tenure, I am pairing my personal philosophy ? to remain “student-centered, faculty- and staff-focused, and community-minded” ? with an already proven formula for institutional excellence. I believe that this will only further the important contributions made by our university.
Our challenging curriculum runs the gamut from agriculture to cutting-edge engineering to hospitality management to business administration to sustainability. And every year for more than 65 years, our students join with students from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo to construct award-winning floats for the annual Tournament of Roses Parade that is viewed by millions around the world. Like the programs, our students here are as diverse as the range of courses. We welcome and value that diversity. Underrepresented minorities and first-generation college students account for many of the nearly 21,000 undergraduate students. We also are a veteran-friendly campus.
Cal Poly Pomona programs have earned the campus a national reputation and high rankings on lists of best universities in U.S. News & World Report and other publications. The decorated and committed faculty along with our dedicated staff have helped the university achieve these lofty academic accomplishments.
Whether you are looking for information about admissions requirements, financial aid guidelines, details about the curriculum, want to make a gift to the university, or just want to get acquainted with Cal Poly Pomona, you’ll be able to find what you need on our website.
While you browse through the pages of www.cpp.edu, you’ll also see our commitment to provide an outstanding and affordable education. The cornerstone of a Cal Poly Pomona education is our “learn-by-doing” philosophy that joins theory with practice, and prepares our students for the working world. Consequently, our graduates are highly regarded and much sought after in business, industry, and other professional fields. We have renowned alumni who are making a difference in their communities.
Cal Poly Pomona remains committed to providing students with the highest-quality education possible and serving as a vital resource to the region and beyond. Enjoy getting to know our great university. Thank you for visiting Cal Poly Pomona!

Why Cal Poly Pomona
A Polytechnic Approach
Cal Poly Pomona is one of only two polytechnic universities of the 23 California State University campuses and 11 in the nation.
The classical meaning of polytechnic is “skilled in many arts.” At Cal Poly Pomona, it means more than that. Here, we weave technology and hands-on learning experiences into our academic programs, bringing textbook concepts to life in a technologically advanced and multicultural world. Students also experience a broad-based education through our general education program. All of our academic disciplines embrace the teaching of theory through application. We take a multi-faceted approach to problem solving, looking at a situation from all possible angles. A biology student might use digital image analysis to monitor the growth of a virus. An urban and regional planning student might use GIS (geographic information systems) to chart the shrinking of low-income housing in an urban area.
This focus on actions and solutions turns our students into skilled workers, integrative problem solvers and well-balanced leaders.
Learning By Doing

When you set out to learn something new, there’s no substitute for rolling up your sleeves and seeing how things work. When you graduate from Cal Poly Pomona, you won’t just know theory. You will be acutely aware of your edge in knowing how to solve real-world problems. So will employers and clients.
At Cal Poly Pomona, you’ll learn the latest thinking and the most innovative and effective ways to get a job done. Whether it’s a journalism student interning for a local newspaper, a political science major placed at city hall for a special project or an animal science student with the opportunity to birth a foal, Cal Poly Pomona students learn by doing.

A Diverse Community
Affordable and Accessible
Quality Learning Experience
The college experience at Cal Poly Pomona isn’t just a series of classes and exams. It’s a special time and place--one that’s ripe with opportunity. All you have to do is step up and take it. For whatever kind of student you are, Cal Poly Pomona offers programs inviting you to make the most of your education.

President's Welcome
Welcome to our website. I am honored to be the new president of Cal Poly Pomona. I have been entrusted with continuing the academic excellence of this university and enriching the quality of student life. I have gained a deep respect for the traditions here. Naturally, I have also enjoyed the unmatched beauty of this campus.
As I begin my tenure, I am pairing my personal philosophy ? to remain “student-centered, faculty- and staff-focused, and community-minded” ? with an already proven formula for institutional excellence. I believe that this will only further the important contributions made by our university.
Our challenging curriculum runs the gamut from agriculture to cutting-edge engineering to hospitality management to business administration to sustainability. And every year for more than 65 years, our students join with students from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo to construct award-winning floats for the annual Tournament of Roses Parade that is viewed by millions around the world. Like the programs, our students here are as diverse as the range of courses. We welcome and value that diversity. Underrepresented minorities and first-generation college students account for many of the nearly 21,000 undergraduate students. We also are a veteran-friendly campus.
Cal Poly Pomona programs have earned the campus a national reputation and high rankings on lists of best universities in U.S. News & World Report and other publications. The decorated and committed faculty along with our dedicated staff have helped the university achieve these lofty academic accomplishments.
Whether you are looking for information about admissions requirements, financial aid guidelines, details about the curriculum, want to make a gift to the university, or just want to get acquainted with Cal Poly Pomona, you’ll be able to find what you need on our website.
While you browse through the pages of www.cpp.edu, you’ll also see our commitment to provide an outstanding and affordable education. The cornerstone of a Cal Poly Pomona education is our “learn-by-doing” philosophy that joins theory with practice, and prepares our students for the working world. Consequently, our graduates are highly regarded and much sought after in business, industry, and other professional fields. We have renowned alumni who are making a difference in their communities.
Cal Poly Pomona remains committed to providing students with the highest-quality education possible and serving as a vital resource to the region and beyond. Enjoy getting to know our great university. Thank you for visiting Cal Poly Pomona!

"Education offers the greatest opportunity for really improving one generation over another."

- W.K. Kellogg

A Brief History

Cal Poly Pomona opened on Sept. 15, 1938, with an all-male enrollment of 110 students as the Voorhis Unit of California State Polytechnic College in San Luis Obispo. It was located on the 150-acre San Dimas site of the former Voorhis School for Boys.
Breakfast cereal magnate W.K. Kellogg deeded 813 acres of land located three miles south of the Voorhis campus to the state of California in 1949.
In 1956, 508 students and 44 faculty and staff moved from San Dimas to the Kellogg campus. In a first for the all-male campus, 329 women joined the student body in 1961. The Pomona campus separated from the San Luis Obispo campus in 1966 and became California State Polytechnic College, Kellogg Campus. University status was granted in 1972.
Today, the university is part of the 23-campus California State University system. Cal Poly Pomona has about 24,000 students and 2,600 faculty and staff.

The Kellogg Connection
Cal Poly Pomona was founded on a legacy of giving, with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and its namesake founder being the driving force.
What is now the green wooded expanse of the university was originally the winter ranch home of W.K. Kellogg, of breakfast cereal fame. Cal Poly Pomona has carefully preserved many features of Kellogg’s hilltop Arabian horse ranch, including his mansion, rose gardens, avocado groves, stables and, of course, the award-winning Kellogg Arabian horses, featured in horse shows on campus.
In 1925, breakfast cereal pioneer W.K. Kellogg established his winter residence and ranch in the rolling hills of what is now the northern edge of the campus. He created a lush landscape, built an ultra-modern house and invited the public to enjoy performances by his prized Arabian horses. Hollywood stars often visited, and Kellogg lent some of his herd for use in movies.
In 1949, two years before Kellogg's death, the foundation that bears his name deeded the land to California’s state college system providing the land be used for educational purposes and the traditional horse shows that he launched in 1926 would continue. The gift reflected Kellogg’s long-held love for horses and belief that “education offers the greatest opportunity for really improving one generation over another.”
Kellogg’s former winter residence and horse ranch eventually formed the core of the Cal Poly Pomona campus. In 1956, 508 students and 44 faculty and staff moved from the San Dimas campus to the Kellogg campus.
Through the years, the university and its students have benefited from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation’s generosity, including funds to establish scholarships and build the W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center.
In 2010, the foundation bearing Kellogg’s name again provided a transformational gift to the university through a record-breaking challenge grant. The $42 million gift was a record cash gift to the CSU and came at a propitious time for the university, coinciding with the downturn in the economy and the launch of the university’s ambitious $150 million comprehensive fundraising campaign.
Sterling K. Speirn, the foundation’s president and CEO, explained Kellogg was a strong believer in higher education.
“His vision of ‘investing in people’ has translated into the foundation's fundamental belief that access to a high-quality education is vital to enhancing the lives of vulnerable youth.”
Cal Poly Pomona is built on the same fundamental belief. While the university’s programs are ranked among the nation’s best, it continues provide affordable and accessible educational opportunities for generations of students to come.
Cal Poly Pomona has long been the gateway to opportunity for generations of Californians. Through Kellogg’s foresight and generosity, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation is helping to ensure that the gateway remains open.

Kellogg House Pomona, A Home With History

Offering sweeping views and rich architectural accents, W.K. Kellogg’s West Coast retreat, Kellogg House, was built in 1926 and cost $150,000.
The home, which sits atop a tree-shrouded hill on the northern edge of campus, was designed by renowned architect Myron Hunt, whose projects included the Pasadena Rose Bowl and the Huntington Library. Charles Gibbs Adams, a distinguished landscape architect who worked on the Hearst Castle gardens in San Simeon, California, designed the lush and colorful surroundings at Kellogg House.
Although the home is 8,777 square feet, it evokes a more intimate feel because of its many rooms. Kellogg’s family and friends often visited the house. The extra rooms allowed Kellogg House to serve as lodging for the Army during World War II.
The architectural décor is typical of a ranch-style house, but also features much finer details, such as the ceiling beams in the dining room where Kellogg’s initials are worked into the pattern.
Additionally, the pipes from an organ were cleverly built into the basement, thus creating more space in the living area without sacrificing Kellogg’s beloved musical instrument.
When the Kellogg family invited guests, the home was a magnet for celebrities of their day, including former President Ronald Reagan, Walt Disney, Will Rogers, Rudolph Valentino, Gary Cooper and Charles Lindbergh. Kellogg and his famous guests would enjoy walking around the grounds and visiting the Arabian horses.
Kellogg House hasn’t changed much since 1926. Most of the furniture and décor that adorn the house are original pieces once owned by Kellogg and his family. This landmark house is open to the public for tours and is available for conferences, weddings and other special events.
Kellogg House exudes vintage charm, offers mesmerizing views and accommodates groups of up to 200, making it the ideal location to celebrate any occasion.

Kellogg House Pomona, A Home With History

Offering sweeping views and rich architectural accents, W.K. Kellogg’s West Coast retreat, Kellogg House, was built in 1926 and cost $150,000.
The home, which sits atop a tree-shrouded hill on the northern edge of campus, was designed by renowned architect Myron Hunt, whose projects included the Pasadena Rose Bowl and the Huntington Library. Charles Gibbs Adams, a distinguished landscape architect who worked on the Hearst Castle gardens in San Simeon, California, designed the lush and colorful surroundings at Kellogg House.
Although the home is 8,777 square feet, it evokes a more intimate feel because of its many rooms. Kellogg’s family and friends often visited the house. The extra rooms allowed Kellogg House to serve as lodging for the Army during World War II.
The architectural décor is typical of a ranch-style house, but also features much finer details, such as the ceiling beams in the dining room where Kellogg’s initials are worked into the pattern.
Additionally, the pipes from an organ were cleverly built into the basement, thus creating more space in the living area without sacrificing Kellogg’s beloved musical instrument.
When the Kellogg family invited guests, the home was a magnet for celebrities of their day, including former President Ronald Reagan, Walt Disney, Will Rogers, Rudolph Valentino, Gary Cooper and Charles Lindbergh. Kellogg and his famous guests would enjoy walking around the grounds and visiting the Arabian horses.

Title -> Lesson: Working with URLs (The Java™ Tutorials > Custom Networking)
The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases and might use technology no longer available. See JDK Release Notes for information about new features, enhancements, and removed or deprecated options for all JDK releases.
Lesson: Working with URLs
URL is the acronym for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a reference (an address) to a resource on the Internet. You provide URLs to your favorite Web browser so that it can locate files on the Internet in the same way that you provide addresses on letters so that the post office can locate your correspondents.
Java programs that interact with the Internet also may use URLs to find the resources on the Internet they wish to access. Java programs can use a class called URL in the java.net package to represent a URL address.
The term URL can be ambiguous. It can refer to an Internet address or a URL object in a Java program. Where the meaning of URL needs to be specific, this text uses "URL address" to mean an Internet address and "URL object" to refer to an instance of the URL class in a program.
What Is a URL?
A URL takes the form of a string that describes how to find a resource on the Internet. URLs have two main components: the protocol needed to access the resource and the location of the resource.
Creating a URL
Within your Java programs, you can create a URL object that represents a URL address. The URL object always refers to an absolute URL but can be constructed from an absolute URL, a relative URL, or from URL components.
Parsing a URL
Gone are the days of parsing a URL to find out the host name, filename, and other information. With a valid URL object you can call any of its accessor methods to get all of that information from the URL without doing any string parsing!
Reading Directly from a URL
This section shows how your Java programs can read from a URL using the openStream() method.
Connecting to a URL
If you want to do more than just read from a URL, you can connect to it by calling openConnection() on the URL. The openConnection() method returns a URLConnection object that you can use for more general communications with the URL, such as reading from it, writing to it, or querying it for content and other information.
Reading from and Writing to a URLConnection
Some URLs, such as many that are connected to cgi-bin scripts, allow you to (or even require you to) write information to the URL. For example, a search script may require detailed query data to be written to the URL before the search can be performed. This section shows you how to write to a URL and how to get results back.
